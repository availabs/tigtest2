Solution: [rubygems activerecord5-redshift-adapter](https://rubygems.org/gems/activerecord5-redshift-adapter)

## Paritioned

### Problem summary

Latest version of Paritioned only supports activerecord v4.

- [rubygems partiioned](https://rubygems.org/gems/partitioned)
- [github fiksu/partitioned](https://github.com/fiksu/partitioned/)

```sh
$ bundle install
Warning: the running version of Bundler (2.1.4) is older than the version that created the lockfile (2.2.22). We suggest you to upgrade to the version that created the lockfile by running `gem install bundler:2.2.22`.

Resolving dependencies...
Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem "activerecord":
  In snapshot (Gemfile.lock):
    activerecord (= 5.2.6)

  In Gemfile:
    partitioned was resolved to 2.1.0, which depends on
      activerecord (~> 4.2.1)

    rails (= 5.2.6) was resolved to 5.2.6, which depends on
      activerecord (= 5.2.6)

Running `bundle update` will rebuild your snapshot from scratch, using only
the gems in your Gemfile, which may resolve the conflict.
```

### Temporary solution

Removed the dependency.
This will cause all the above usages to break.

### Potential Remedies

- [Forked version?](https://github.com/fiksu/partitioned/issues/70)
- [rkrage/pg_party](https://github.com/rkrage/pg_party)
  - [working with partitioned tables in rails](https://lcx.wien/blog/working-with-partitioned-tables-in-rails/)

## NoMethodError: undefined method `whitelist_attributes=' for ActiveRecord::Base:Class

### Solution

See: [Rails issue 13740](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/13740#issuecomment-121092380)

Commented out line in `config/application.rb`.

## NoMethodError: undefined method `mass_assignment_sanitizer=' for ActiveRecord::Base:Class

### Temporary Solution

Commented out the following lines:

```sh
$ ag mass_assignment_sanitizer
config/environments/test.rb
35:  config.active_record.mass_assignment_sanitizer = :strict

config/environments/development.rb
35:  config.active_record.mass_assignment_sanitizer = :strict
```

## Sprockets::Railtie::ManifestNeededError: Expected to find a manifest file in `app/assets/config/manifest.js`
